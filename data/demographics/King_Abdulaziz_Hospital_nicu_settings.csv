FINDINGS: 
The endotracheal tube tip is adjacent to the carina for readjustment.
Enteric feeding tube is noted in satisfactory position.
Interval improvement of right upper lobe areation; however there is interval development of left retrocardiac airspace opacity likely representing consolidation/collapse.
Mild obliteration of the left costophrenic angle likely representing small pleural effusion.
No pneumothorax.

FINDINGS:
Satisfactory position of the enteric feeding tube.
Stable position of the right PICC line and a right drainage chest tube.
New insertion of endotracheal tube that seen at low position at carina level, for readjustment.

Interval improvement of lung aeration bilaterally.
Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.
No apparent pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

The imaged upper abdomen and osseous structures are unremarkable.

FINDINGS:
The patient's head is rotated to the left. Endotracheal tube is slightly high in position, for adjustment.
The enteric feeding tube seen in proper position.
Partially visualized of the umbilicals catheter noted.

Redemonstration of multiple linear and rounded lucency involving lungs which likely representing pulmonary interstitial emphysema.
Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angles could be due to small pleural effusion.
There is no appreciated pneumothorax.
No additional changes.                                                                                                                                                                                     Author:NAME   DATE & TIME

COMPARISON:
Previous x-ray done on the same date.

FINDINGS:
Endotracheal tube is seen slightly in high position; for readjustment.
Enteric feeding tube is noted with its tip at the gastroesophageal junction to be further advanced.

There is interval resolution of right complete lobe opacity with interval improvement of right lung aeration. Moreover, interval development of a left complete lobe opacity with ipsilateral mediastinal shift which is likely representing collapse. No pneumothorax. 

The osseous structures are unremarkable.                                                                                                                                             Author:  Author:NAME   DATE & TIME
